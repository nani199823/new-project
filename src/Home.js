        <h2>THE GATEWAY ARCH</h2>
        <p>The Gateway Arch is a 190-metre (623 ft) monument in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Clad in stainless steel and built 
          in the form of a weighted catenary arch, it is the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible building. Some 
          sources consider it the tallest man-made monument in the Western Hemisphere. Built as a monument to the westward expansion 
          of the United States and officially dedicated to "the American people", the Arch, commonly referred to as "The Gateway to the 
          West", is the centerpiece of Gateway Arch National Park and has become an internationally recognized symbol of St. Louis, as 
          well as a popular tourist destination </p>
